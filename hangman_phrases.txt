Happy as a clam
Piece of cake
Apple of my eye
A penny for your thoughts
Break the ice
The best of both worlds
Let the cat out of the bag
A dime a dozen
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Actions speak louder than words
A picture is worth a thousand words
The ball is in your court
Beat around the bush
Bite the bullet
Every cloud has a silver lining
A chip on your shoulder
Close but no cigar
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut to the chase
Cry over spilt milk
A drop in the bucket
Hit the hay
Hit the nail on the head
Kill two birds with one stone
Learn the ropes
Let sleeping dogs lie
Make a long story short
A penny saved is a penny earned
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
A piece of the pie
Put all your eggs in one basket
The early bird catches the worm
Speak of the devil
A taste of your own medicine
The icing on the cake
When pigs fly
The world is your oyster
A watched pot never boils
Break a leg
Get your act together
Hit the road
